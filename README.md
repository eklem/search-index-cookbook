# search-index-cookbook
A collection of recipes and how to's on interesting use cases with [search-index](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/search-index)
Feel free to [suggest a new topic](https://github.com/eklem/search-index-cookbook/issues/new) you want explained. We've created a [simple indexer for debug purposes](/eklem/search-index-indexer) so it's easy to test out any given JSON data set and config.

## Topics

- [Autosuggest: How to use the matcher](/doc/topics/autosuggest.md)
- [Create your own stopwords list, filter out the weed](/doc/topics/stopwords-filtering-away-garbage.md)
- [How to tune relevancy?](/doc/topics/field-weighting.md)
- [Index size and searching speed tradeoffs](/doc/topics/size-speed-tradeoffs.md)

## Pitfalls

- [Data indexed but no search results](/doc/topics/pitfalls.md#data-indexed-but-no-search-results)
- [Facets / filters not working](/doc/topics/pitfalls.md#facets--filters-not-working)
