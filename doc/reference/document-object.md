# Document object

A document or item object always consist of at least two fields. An `id`-field and then at least one field for content. If you don't specify an id, `search-index` will create one.

## Document example
This example is to better help you understand the connection between [configuration](/doc/reference/configuration.md), the content / document / item going into the index, and the [query object](/doc/reference/query-object.md), getting the stuff out again.
