You shouldn't need to code much to learn the basics of search-index. For the no-code approach thera are two things you need to do first.

# Indexing some data for testing
Use the [search-index-indexer](https://github.com/eklem/search-index-indexer) to index your data. You need your dataset and config file as JSON.

# Querying your data
The guide uses `norch` as a minimal web server. It exposes thesearch API of `search-index` as JSON, ready for you to tinker with in the URL field of your browser. Point `norch` to your data and start querying.
