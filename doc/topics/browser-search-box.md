# Browser search with autosuggest
There is a standard called [OpenSearch](http://www.opensearch.org/) that defines how a browser search box and a search engine should interact. More exact what a search engine should return and have to be autodiscovered by browsers' search box and how to set up autosuggest / autogcomplete in the browser for your search engine.

## What you need
- A search index
- norch (with search-index) installed, pointing to your search index
- A frontend, i.e norch-angular-app or any other search frontend of your choice

## Duplicate the norch matcher
You don't have to duplicate the [`search-index-matcher`](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/search-index-matcher), but okay to do if you don't want to ruin your search solution's autosuggest, if you have one.

Call it opensearchsuggest. It will be the endpoint that the opensearch.xml reference to, and that the browser searchbox talks to.

### What the matcher returns out of the box:
For "que" as the query:

```json
["query",
 "query suggestion",
 "query completion"
]
```

### What you want it to return:
For "que" as the query:

```json
["que",
  ["query",
   "query+suggestion",
   "query+completion"
  ]
]
```
So you want it to return the actuall query as well. And it's wrapped as an array because it can be expanded to contain number of document hits and a kind of redirect URL. The redirect URL means you can use the search engine as a autosuggest only, and redirect to another instance of your search engine or another search engine.

The full array could look somethin like:

```json
["que",
  ["query",
   "query+suggestion",
   "query+completion"
  ],
  ["123 results",
   "97 results",
   "4 results"
  ],
  [
   "http://google.com?q=query",
   "http://google.com?q=query+suggestion",
   "http://google.com?q=query+completion",
  ]
]
```


## opensearch.xml
On your webserver / webapp root, create the file `opensearchdescription.xml`. Change the `[URL]` to your URL:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<OpenSearchDescription xmlns="http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/">
    <ShortName>Life Index</ShortName>
    <Description>Your digital life searchable</Description>
    <Tags>search</Tags>
    <Contact>[your.email@address.com]</Contact>
    <Image height="16" width="16" type="image/x-icon">http://[URL]:3030/images/favicon.ico</Image>
    <Image height="64" width="64" type="image/png">http://[URL]:3030/images/favicon.png</Image>
    <Url type="application/x-suggestions+json"
        rel="suggestions" method="GET"
        template="http://[URL]:3030/opensearchsuggests?beginsWith={searchTerms}" />
    <Url type="text/html" method="GET"
        template="http://[URL]:3030/#/search?q={searchTerms}&amp;facets=user,type,tags"/>
</OpenSearchDescription>
```
